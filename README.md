This is a simple chat server that I wrote for a coding interview. It can be accessed through telnet, and it supports a subset of IRC commands. There were no attempts to make it secure, and I doubt it scales well, at least for now.

You will need Python 2.x and the Twisted framework to run this. The tests can be run using "trial <test>".
